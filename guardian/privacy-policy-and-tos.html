<h1>Guardian Privacy Policy and Terms Of Service</h1>

Our privacy policy attempts to disclose what type of data is collected by Guardian in simple to understand terms.

* When an alert is triggered, Guardian uses a secure connection (SSL/TLS) to send the alert details to our server so that the email can be reliably sent. The secure connection prevents these details from being intercepted between your device and our server.
* We use your name, email address and captured photos so that we can send the information to you through the alert mail.
* We do not use any of your data for any purpose other than serving you better. We may have to share some information with some trusted third parties for the sole purpose of serving you using thier service (like email sending service). But rest assured, none of this information is up for sale.
* We use Google Analytics to learn usage pattern so that we can improve our app.

We have only the best intentions for the privacy of our users so we hope this satisfies your curiosity.


Terms of service

* Do not misuse the service. For example, do not use the app to send unintended emails to other users without their consent.
* We preserve the sole right to change / update our privacy policy and terms of service at any time with or without notifying you.
* To prevent our service from being misused and to serve everyone better, we may limit the number of emails you're allowed to send in a certain interval. We preserve the right to update the interval and/or the number of emails you are allowed to send with or without notifying you.
* We preserve the sole right to discontinue our service(s) at any time with or without notifying you.
